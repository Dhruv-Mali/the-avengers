    <div class="main3">
        <p>First up, here's how to watch the Marvel movies in release order.
            Marvel films, we should note, are split into Phases, with the end of a Phase typically indicating a natural end to a story arc.
            The beginning of a Phase, therefore, signals the introduction of new, important characters. Below, we go through Phases 1 to 4 in release order.
            Yes, that includes WandaVision/Falcon and The Winter Soldier/Loki/Moon Knight. They're not movies, but the Disney Plus series are just as important to the overarching story.</p>

        <p><b>I</b>ron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
        The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.
        The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).

            When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. 
            Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries.
            He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. 
            Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>

            Captain America: The First Avenger is a 2011 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America. 
            Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 
            The film was directed by Joe Johnston, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / 
            Captain America alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, 
            and Stanley Tucci. During World War II, Steve Rogers, a frail man, is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop

        </p>
        <p>
            The film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for distribution by Artisan Entertainment. 
            However, a lawsuit disrupted the project and was not settled until September 2003. In 2005, 
            Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch, and planned to finance and release the film 
            through Paramount Pictures. Directors Jon Favreau and Louis Leterrier were interested in directing 
            the project before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March
            and June 2010. Production began in June, and filming took place in London, Manchester, Caerwent, 
            Liverpool, and Los Angeles. Several different techniques were used by the visual effects company Lola
             to create the physical appearance of the character before he becomes Captain America.
        </p>
        <p>
            Captain America: The First Avenger premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on July 19, 2011, and was released in the 
            United States on July 22, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $370 
            million worldwide. Critics particularly praised Evans' performance, the film's depiction of its 1940s time period, 
            and Johnston's direction. Two sequels have been released: Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and
             Captain America: Civil War (2016).

        <p>Sam Raimi first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on Thor in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in

        Protosevich to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. Matthew Vaughn was assigned to
        direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached 
        and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in California 
          and   New Mexico from January to May 2010. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.</p>

            see Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe). For other uses, see Hulk (disambiguation) and The Incredible Hulk 
            (disambiguation).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, 
            the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has 
            dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing
            a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved
             physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically 
            transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to 
            conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly
            portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from a mindless, destructive force (War), to a brilliant warrior 
            (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil/Immortal), a genius scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and a gangster (Joe Fixit). It is later 
            revealed Banner's DID formed from being abused by his father Brian as a child and that the alter egos known as Fixit and the Devil/Immortal Hulk originally
            manifested during his childhood, with a malevolent identity embodying his guilt, shame, and regret towards his father (based on him) manifesting as the Guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner's ex-wife Betty Ross, his best friend Rick 
            Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the 
            superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him 
            into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this, he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as the Leader, the Abomination, 
            the Absorbing Man and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.[3] Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout
         the character's publication history, the most usual color is green.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,[4][5] the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world 
            structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. 
            The character was first played in live-action by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in the 1978 television series The Incredible Hulk and its subsequent television films The Incredible 
            Hulk Returns (1988), The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (1989), and The Death of the Incredible Hulk (1990), then by Eric Bana in the film Hulk (2003). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
            (MCU), the character was first portrayed by Edward Norton in the film The Incredible Hulk (2008) and then by Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of
            Ultron (2015), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), the television
            series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), and the animated series What If...? (2021), where Ruffalo reprised the role.
